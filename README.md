# Network-Diagram
Node and Edge Diagram using Networkx.
This Code is designed to only plot the nodes and edges depending on X,Y .
Threfore you need to create the Unique Id(0,1,2...) for the all Nodes(Refer the photoes).
And assign to corresponding nodes using Vlookups or anything.
Acoourding to that id assign that id for x,y  and if you want edge types add those data as Type column. 
Then run it.
